# SwiftPracticeDemos
This is a Swift practice demo project inspired by allen wong, whose GitHub address is https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift. The little demos are refer to allen wong's demos but the codes here is written by myself. There is a little different between my demo and allen wong's, which is I write my demos in just one project, while he in different project. Hope it is helpful in the future and can others.
